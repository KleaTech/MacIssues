# MacIssues

- Mouse acceleration cannot be turned off
  - Note: Maybe it's turned off when the speed is set to lowest, but it's unusable at that setting, at least with a mouse with around 2000dpi.
  - Solution: https://triq.net/mac/mouse-acceleration (System Settings apps might have to be started after restart to work, needs testing.)
- Home/end button does not move cursor to start/end of line, instead it moves page to top/bottomm.
  - Note: shortcut override (eg. with BTT) does not work consistently and terminal needs additional steps.
